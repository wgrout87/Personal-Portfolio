# William Grout - Personal Portfolio

## Description
This repository contains my personal portfolio. It is a website design that I have built from the ground up to showcase both myself and some of the projects I have worked on.The 'Work' section is styled such that the first project I ever coded has a larger card than any subsequent works that will be added. More projects will be added in the coming weeks.

Technologies used include HTML and CSS.

## Features
* Flexbox and media queries allow for responsive design that adopts to viewport
* Navigation buttons will direct viewers to each corresponding section
* CSS allows for simple addition of new cards into the 'Work' section by only modifying the HTML
* Clicking on the cards in the 'Work' section will redirect to those deployed projects
