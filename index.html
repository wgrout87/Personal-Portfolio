                For the past six years, I have been pursuing a passion for cooking by working in the restaurant industry. While engaged in that pursuit, I gained a wealth of skills that I belief will provide a wealth of benefits to all areas of my life. In particular, I learned to work effectively with a team, the value of clear communicaiton, and the importance of understanding customer needs.

                I was working on a food truck, and they seemed to be the most heavily impacted by restrctions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. With my job so negatively impacted, I turned my sites elsewhere with the hope that I could apply the same drive to reach similar levels of personal acheivement and success as a full stack web developer.
